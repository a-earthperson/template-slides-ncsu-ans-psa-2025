	abstract = {The notion of nuclear reactors with battery-like capabilities, called fission batteries, puts forth system requirements and design constraints that have so far been unseen in the nuclear power production industry. Such restrictions require fission batteries to be modular, integrated, autonomous, tamper-proof (i.e., resilient, fault-tolerant, all-weather, and safe), and affordable. With design requirements specifying no human intervention for operation, and minimal connectivity to remote monitoring networks, fission batteries are unique among existing nuclear power plants and emerging advanced reactor designs. Given these attributes, traditional probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) of fission batteries is expected to require dynamic methods to model advanced aspects, such as self-diagnosis, self-adjustment, and duration-prediction capabilities, as they are key ingredients for unattended operations. In addition, availability models need to integrate autonomous control, associated error-detection algorithms, and adversarial human actions. Currently, no existing framework demonstrably assesses these advanced attributes. This paper introduces and demonstrates an integrated framework for the dynamic modeling of fission battery designs. The proposed framework comprises a combined modeling strategy that uses the dual-graph error propagation methodology (DEPM) based on the continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models implemented in OpenPRA Error Propagation (OpenErrorPro) and the dynamic PRA tool, Event Modeling Risk Assessment using Linked Diagrams (EMRALD), based on discrete dynamic event trees (DDET). This combination overcomes some of the limitations of the tools when used independently. It enables detailed dynamic analysis to produce time explicit results to support the development of fission battery traditional PRA models. To evaluate the utility of this novel approach, a demonstration case is shown that models the hypothesized response of a fission battery design to an external fire event. DEPM CTMCs and alternative failure approaches are coupled with EMRALD to characterize and quantify the likelihood of the event sequences. The results show that the combined framework effectively captures the dynamic aspects of fission battery design in terms of the timing and realism of modeled events. Given the complexity of the failure scenarios, we believe that EMRALD and DEPM are necessary and complementary when the need for high-resolution analysis offsets the challenges of detailed modeling.},

	abstract = {Adoption of electronic Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts in various industrial products is rapidly increasing due to the accessibility and appealing lower cost of these commodities. Depending on the type of application, having an accurate understanding of the COTS failure information can be crucial to ensure the reliability and safety of the final products. On the other hand, frequent large-scale testing is often cost prohibitive and time consuming for emerging technologies, especially in the consumer electronics sector where minimizing time-to-market and cost is critical. This paper presents a comprehensive Bayesian approach and software platform (named COTS Reliability Expert System), that integrates multiple pieces of heterogeneous information about the failure rate of COTS parts. The ultimate goal is to reduce dependency on testing for reliability analysis and yet to obtain a more accurate “order of magnitude” estimate of the failure rate through an efficient process. The method provides a foundation for incorporating manufacturers reliability data, estimates based on underlying physics-of-failure mechanisms and circuit simulations, partially relevant life test data of similar (but not necessarily identical) parts, and expert opinions on the manufacturing process of the COTS part of interest. The developed expert system uses Bayesian estimation to integrate all these types of evidence. The methodology is demonstrated in estimating the failure rate of a static random-access memory (SRAM) part.},

	abstract = {This paper conducts a focused probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) on the reliability of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) drones deployed for surveillance in areas with diverse radiation levels following a nuclear accident. The study employs the event tree/fault tree digraph approach, integrated with the dual-graph error propagation method (DEPM), to model sequences that could lead to loss of mission (LOM) scenarios due to combined hardware–software failures in the drone’s navigation system. The impact of radiation is simulated by a comparison of the total ionizing dose (TID) with the acceptable limit for each component. Errors are then propagated within the electronic hardware and software blocks to determine the navigation system’s reliability in different radiation zones. If the system is deemed unreliable, a strategy is suggested to identify the minimum radiation-hardening requirement for its subcomponents by reverse-engineering from the desired mission success criteria. The findings of this study can aid in the integration of COTS components into radiation-hardened (RAD-HARD) designs, optimizing the balance between cost, performance, and reliability in drone systems for nuclear-contaminated search and rescue missions.},

	abstract = {Advancements in nuclear system designs with automated control features provide many benefits, but can lead to complex coupled systems and dynamic failure scenarios. This is especially true for microreactor designs where components are not expected to be replaced during the reactor’s lifetime. Hence, the life of the system, in addition to the safety, needs to be evaluated. Modeling these sequences of time-dependent events requires addressing cyclical processes and changing failure rates in ways that represent the actual system dynamics in contrast to a single sampling for a component’s time to failure. This research presents two distinct analytical methods for several failure distributions that evaluate a final time to failure used for different scenarios where the time to failure must be sampled multiple times. The first method is used when evaluating a component whose failure rate increases due to an outside event after the initial sampling but before the initially sampled time to failure. The second method is used when evaluating multiple identical components or a component that has been replaced with a new identical version before the second sampling. The two methods were implemented in a few representative case studies developed in the dynamic probabilistic risk assessment tool Event Modeling Risk Assessment using Linked Diagrams. Overall, this paper provides guidelines on how these approaches give a more realistic and accurate dynamic probabilistic risk assessment of complex systems.},

            Transportation systems play a pivotal role in modern society, but they are not without inherent risks and inefficiencies. This paper explores the integration of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance safety and cost optimization in hazardous materials (HAZMAT) transportation. Traditional PRA methods, while robust, are limited by the quality and quantity of data available for analysis. ML techniques can address these limitations by analyzing large datasets, identifying patterns, and making accurate predictions. The integration of ML techniques into PRA can enhance data analysis, prediction capabilities, routing decisions, resource allocation, and decision-making processes in HAZMAT transportation. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on PRA and ML within the transportation industry, discusses the potential benefits of integrating these approaches, examines the challenges associated with transportation accident data, and suggests areas for further research and improvements in HAZMAT transportation safety analysis.},

            Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) tools are crucial in the nuclear, aerospace, maritime, and chemical industries. This paper presents OpenPRA, an innovative, open-source, web-based platform designed to address the limitations of current Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) tools. OpenPRA offers a collaborative and flexible environment that supports a wide array of risk models and quantification engines, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of risk assessment processes. The platform offers unique features including support for various risk models such as event trees, fault trees, Markov chains, Bayesian networks, and error propagation models. It also allows users to choose from a variety of existing quantification engines, enabling them to tailor their risk assessment process to their specific needs. The paper discusses the design, development, and potential of OpenPRA to transform the field of PRA. It also delves into the platform’s technical architecture, technology stack, and the OpenPRA Model Exchange Format. The paper concludes by outlining the current development status of OpenPRA and laying out the foundation for future work.},

            The development of the nuclear industry’s Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) has significantly contributed to the design, reliability, and safety of nuclear power plants (NPP). Today, PRAs form integration in all nuclear power plant development stages, including design, licensing, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning. Many legacy PRA tools have been used in the nuclear field; however, more powerful tools are needed to cope with the rapid development of the nuclear industry and NPP designs. These tools are now required to analyze new aspects of the plants that were never envisioned before, and more computational resources are needed.
            This study uses synthetically generated fault trees of various sizes and specifications to benchmark fault tree solvers; XFTA version 1.3.1 and SCRAM version 0.16.2. The analysis is performed in two steps. The first step is to compare the probabilities, minimal cut sets, and importance factors. The second step is measuring CPU time, wall time, and the memory usage of each engine for benchmarking. The result for the first step for the same configuration is the same for each calculation engine. Overall, XFTA can complete most of the given runs in a shorter time with less memory usage than SCRAM. All computations and measurements are done on a specified computer.},

            The approval process from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for nuclear power plants is sequential. It involves several government bodies such as the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), public meetings, and hearings. If the submissions made to the NRC do not contain enough information to meet the regulation requirements, the NRC issues a Request for Additional Information (RAI). Thus, the licensee has to go through a paperwork-intensive process that involves multiple regulatory agencies for the various licensing requirements. Moreover, sending applications to the NRC is limited to using an electronic submission generation tool called the Packing Slip Wizard (PSW).
            This paper presents a methodology to implement Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to address the need for a real-time, digitized documentation platform in the nuclear power industry’s licensing and regulation process.
            The evaluation of DLT’s implementation resulted in the formulation of a methodology to accept submissions from an applicant on a web application and storing the received data on a distributed ledger. The presented method offers a real-time submission of the available information of an application. It facilitates the NRC with a real-time feedback capability expediting the review process. RAI’s can be reduced in number by ensuring that the NRC’s information requirements are defined as smart contracts.},

            Today, Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) plays a vital role in assuring mission success for robotic and crewed missions alike. Current-day PRA techniques integrate multimodal, often black-box analyses to build comprehensive risk profiles. This paper describes a review and verification study of the “Nuclear Risk Assessment for the Mars 2020 Mission Environmental Impact Statement” (N-PRA)[1]. Sandia National Labs conducted the N-PRA for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). More specifically, we have verified the source term calculations associated with the release of radionuclides from a Multi-Mission Radiothermoelectic Generator (MMRTG) power source for a limited set of accident scenarios in the case of an accidental re-entry into Earth Orbit with an Earth impacting trajectory.
            We achieve this by using analytical methods[2] historically implemented for the Cassini Mission PRA[3] for a failed planetary swingby gravity-assist. Our results are within 28\% to 56\% of the referenced study. Limitations in our methodology are attributed to a lack of modern simulation-based tools and deterministic methods for modeling complex physical phenomena. The results are interpreted and compared with the values presented by the initial authors, along with comments for improving our current methodology.},

            We define supply chains (SCs) as sequences of processes that link the demand and supply of goods or services within a network. SCs are prone to shortages in delivering their output goals due to several factors such as personnel undersupply, inefficient processes, policy failure, equipment malfunction, natural hazards, pandemic outbreaks, power outages, or economic crises. Recent notable supply-chain failures include the 2021 Texas power crisis, personal protection equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional or global food chain shortages. The consequences of such shortages can range from negligible to devastating. The Texas power crisis resulted in the death of 70 people and left approximately 4.5 billion homes and businesses without power for multiple days.
            In this paper, we presented a methodology to quantify the failure probability of the throughput of a supply chain. We divided the methodology into two major categories of steps. In the first step, we converted the given or assumed supply chain data into fault trees and quantify them. In the second step, we iterated the quantification of the fault tree to build a supply chain shortage risk profile. We introduced the notion of success criteria for the output from a facility, based on which we included or excluded the facility for quantification.
            With the inclusion of relevant field data, we believe that our methodology can enable the stakeholders in the supply-chain decision-making process to detect vulnerable facilities and risk-inform prevention and mitigation actions. Applications for this methodology can include construction, inventory stocking, assessing manufacturing quantities, policy changes, personnel allocation, and financial investment for critical industries such as nuclear, pharmaceutical, aviation, etc.},

A critical part of our rapid deployment strategy is our Adopt, Adapt, and Advance approach (the 3-A approach) which entails 1) leveraging (adopting), to the maximum extent possible, the best available products (e.g., technologies, processes, tools, etc.) 2) making incremental improvements to (adapting) other available products to add value from the safety and commercial viability points of view , and 3) making transformational changes to (advancing) very specific targeted areas to make a step-wise improvement to the commercial viability attribute. For example, we are leveraging the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s MARVEL a highly promising NaK-cooled thermal spectrum microreactor, which its development was led by Idaho National Laboratory (INL), as the foundation for our technology for the energy generation. We plan to adapt certain design features of MARVEL, to enable higher energy production capability, and we plan to advance the key deployment and operations attributes (e.g., construction speed, outage duration, and operational flexibility, etc.) to make a step change in commercial viability. We also plan to use the same 3-A approach to establish a licensing basis for our plants that support full realization of the promise of this game changing plant by maximizing design and operational flexibility and predictability while ensuring the performance objectives of the regulations, are met with minimal to no unnecessary regulatory burden. This paper describes some of the foundational elements of this strategy. It should be noted that we expect practical considerations, such as available time and resources, may result in a progressive deployment of some of the elements but the licensing basis of our nth of a kind (NOAK) plant will fully include the following elements: • A risk-informed and performance-based (RIPB) safety case for addressing risk to the public that is built by adopting Regulatory Guide-1.233 and its complementary guidance, such as the guidance being developed for establishing Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ). We will adapt this guidance for addressing worker safety and environmental impact. • We will use Technology Inclusive Content of Application (TICAP) and Advanced Reactors Content of Application (ARCAP) guidance to prepare our Combined License Application (COLA). • We plan to establish fully RIPB-based operational programs by adopting those that are under development, such as RIPB change evaluation (TIRICE), and adapting the available * madiacon@ncsu.edu},

This study addresses the limitations and current capabilities of traditional PRA tools and emphasizes the necessity for advancements to align with the evolving needs of the industry. We focus on event tree and fault tree analyses methods, widely used in PRA, utilizing tools like SAPHIRE (with SAPHSOLVE engine), Phoenix Architect (CAFTA with PRAQuant and FTREX engines), XFTA engine, and the recent OpenPRA's SCRAM-cpp (previously called SCRAM) open-source engine. Our study extends previous benchmarking to include the industry most utilized FTREX engine. We conduct a detailed evaluation of SAPHSOLVE, FTREX, XFTA, and SCRAM-cpp, using synthetic fault trees of varying specifications and complexities. The analysis aims to assess the accuracy and efficiency of these tools in terms of time and memory use for calculating top event failure probabilities and minimal cut sets. The results will inform enhancements of current PRA tools and contribute to the development of the OpenPRA software platform moving towards improved PRA methodologies in the nuclear industry.},

	abstract = {Advanced nuclear reactors are ushering in a transformative era in the nuclear energy sector, characterized by generational advancements in safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Central to realizing the advanced reactor philosophy is the integration of digital instrumentation and control (I\&C) systems, which are critical for enhancing the operational integrity, economic viability, and safety of advanced reactor designs. Designed to be vastly more complex than their analog counterparts, digital I\&Cs offer comparatively superior control, diagnostic capabilities, and adaptability. However, added complexity makes failures of such systems inherently hard to describe, let alone predict, due, in part, to their potential for propagating internal errors in manners that are often unintuitive and opaque. Consequently, the use of digital I\&Cs poses new challenges to qualifying reactor safety. Addressing these challenges requires a fundamental rethinking of probabilistic failure modeling. The dual error propagation method (DEPM) is a stochastic technique that allows us to induce and track failure behavior by explicitly representing a system in terms of its control and data flows-two attributes that are sufficient to adequately describe combinatorial logic. However, the physical processes underlying digital systems, like all natural processes, are inherently co-incident. So far, the nature of abstraction requires DEPM models to be sequential and time-agnostic, leading to fundamental inconsistencies that are accepted nonetheless by relaxing modeling assumptions. This paper is an extension to our previous work introducing the concept of multiple control paths within DEPM, aimed to address its sequential limitations. Through a case study on basic digital logic building blocks, we showcase the improved expressivity afforded by multi-control DEPM, emphasizing its potential and limitations in supporting the reliability analysis of larger, more complex digital I\&Cs. Our analysis demonstrates that while multi-control DEPM is feasible, it is fundamentally limited by its inability to explicitly model time. Consequently, accurately modeling race conditions, concurrency, and synchronization without compromising modeling assumptions remains unachievable. Furthermore, multi-control DEPM is computationally expensive due to an exponential increase in the number of modeled states with each added control flow. The issue of this so-called state-space explosion stays largely unresolved within DEPM as a whole. Given these limitations, we conclude by proposing future research directions, including the exploration of alternative time-explicit modeling techniques and strategies for managing model complexity, with a deeper case study to follow.},

PRA thrives on adaptability, accommodating the ramifications of deterministic analyses, design alterations, operational shifts, environmental changes, and evolving regulations to update and refine its risk assessments continually. While PRA tools have existed for over three and a half decades, they have made substantial contributions to these industries. Nevertheless, the contemporary landscape demands the acknowledgment of challenges faced by current PRA tools and, more importantly, the formulation of innovative solutions to address them. These challenges encompass the need for more efficient model construction, seamless model exchange between diverse tools, streamlined model quantification, and the incorporation of multi-hazard risk assessments. In response to these imperatives, we introduce scram-cpp and its node.js wrapper, scram-node, an emerging probabilistic risk assessment quantification engine developed under the open-source web-based OpenPRA software stack. Building upon the foundational work of the legacy SCRAM project, this open-source endeavor aspires to confront the current challenges plaguing PRA tools and pave the way for transformative solutions across all legacy PRA tools.},

	abstract = {This paper delves into the critical need for a simulation-based framework to aid the evaluation of the reliability of digital Instrumentation and Control (I\&C) systems in advanced nuclear power plants, as the industry transitions from analog to digital systems. With limited operational history for digital I\&C systems, simulation-based methods are essential to comprehend their failure modes including Common Cause Failures (CCFs). When two or more components/systems fail due to a single shared cause and coupling mechanism within the specified mission time, we call the failures CCFs. They are quantified using models such as the alpha factor model whose parameters are developed from extensive operational data from nuclear power plants. In this paper, the focus is on laying the groundwork for utilizing Probabilistic Model Checking (PMC) to quantify Common Cause Failure parameters in digital I\&C systems. We selected the causal alpha factor model for the analysis, as it lends itself very well to the development of parameters from operational or simulation data. Along with the causal alpha factor model, we have also selected a digital I\&C component, the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), inspired by its use in commercial nuclear I\&C systems intended for advanced reactors, analyzed its failure causes and classified them according to the system recommended for the causal alpha factor method. By exploring the development of CCF parameters and the application of probabilistic model checking for formal verification of CCFs, this research aims to develop the foundation for modeling the shared causes and the coupling mechanisms of digital I\&Cs in support of developing a simulation-driven database of CCF parameters for digital I\&C systems.},

	abstract = {This pilot study addresses the challenge of optimizing variable ordering in binary decision diagrams (BDDs) for fault tree analysis within probabilistic risk assessment, with a specific focus on addressing the unique challenges posed by advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors, including small modular reactors, present novel operational and safety complexities that demand enhanced computational tools for their safety analysis. The efficiency of BDDs, pivotal in evaluating the reliability of the intricate safety systems of these reactors, is significantly influenced by the sequence in which variables are ordered-a problem recognized as NP-hard. We propose a deep-learning-based heuris-tic, leveraging transformer-backed sequence-to-sequence models, to approximate near-optimal variable ordering for BDDs generated from system fault trees. Our approach involves the development of a representative dataset of boolean functions and their corresponding BDDs, detailing the process of tokenization, numericalization, and normalization of data to train the model effectively. The architecture incorporates an embedding layer, multiple transformer blocks, and a dense layer for sequence predictions, trained using a custom loss function that emphasizes the reduction of larger BDDs for computational efficiency. The model's performance, evaluated through metrics such as multi-class sequence accuracy, reveals a notable challenge in achieving high sequence accuracy, indicating a difficulty in capturing the complex dependencies necessary for optimal variable ordering. Despite a marginal improvement in individual predictions within sequences, the model struggles with the complete and correct prediction of variable orderings, as evidenced by low sequence accuracy metrics observed during training and validation phases. To address these limitations, we propose potential improvements, including the exploration of alternative loss metrics such as connectionist-temporal classification loss, which may better suit the sequence prediction nature of the problem. Additionally, we suggest architectural enhancements and a re-evaluation of the training strategy to improve the model's ability to learn sequential dependencies. This research lays a foundational step towards harnessing deep learning models for solving combinatorial optimization problems in reliability analysis of complex advanced reactor safety systems.},

	abstract = {Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of nuclear safety systems is paramount for preventing severe accidents and ensuring operational safety. This study introduces a method for quantifying the unavailability margins of safety systems, employing inverse estimation techniques to deduce event sequence frequencies. The proposed method is demonstrated on a case study involving a liquid metal fire scenario from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) Level 1 probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). Uncertainties are modeled by assuming log-normal distributions for all events. For a demonstrative event tree with known end-state frequencies, our method accurately deduced the probabilities of functional events within a small error margin. The results show errors of approximately (1.08 ± 0.96)\% for the means, (4.39 ± 7.09)\% for the 5 th , and (3.82 ± 5.91)\% for the 95 th percentiles, respectively. The analysis highlights the method's strengths, such as its ability to estimate distributions for rare events, but also notes limitations, including dependence on specific distribution assumptions and challenges in optimization techniques. Despite these, the case study's results offer the potential for drawing insights for improving safety system design and operational strategies. Additionally, we have made this method available as an open-source Python tool named inverse-canopy, part of the OpenPRA toolkit [1]. The study concludes by discussing the potential of this methodology for broader application in PRAs and suggests future work to expand it into a Bayesian inverse uncertainty quantification framework.},
